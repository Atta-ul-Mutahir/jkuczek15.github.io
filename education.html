	    <h3>Cumulative Reflection</h3>
	    <p>Throughout my career at Iowa State, I have learned a lot about professional Engineering practices and techniques. Iowa State has presented me with many opportunities to learn new technologies and improve on my skills as a Software Engineer. If I were to do my undergraduate again, I would not change a thing.</p>
	    <p>One important thing I learned from the University is that IDE's, programming languages, and database management systems are just tools necessary to accomplish a particular task. If you find yourself doing something repetitive, you're probably doing it wrong. There isn't ever a “perfect” way to design the software you want to create. As things change and more features are requested, the code-base is going to become much more complex. At Iowa State, I learned to consider all aspects of the problem before choosing technologies to build a product. If you don't expect your software to change far down the road, it probably isn't worth it to train your team how to use a complex framework. Another thing I learned is that there will always be trade-offs between development time, run-time, and accuracy, so it is important to plan accordingly to maximize one of them based on the client's needs.</p>
	    <p>I have also learned how to work effectively in groups and lead groups to complete a project. In a few of my classes, I was the Scrum master, so I created, managed, and assigned our development tasks to different members in our group. From these experiences, I have also become familiar with Git as a version control tool. Scrum and Git make it much easier to recognize where a particular change made the software fail. From there, it is as simple as finding the developer who made the change; since they are going to be able to fix the problem the fastest.</p>
	    <p>One major thing I have done to undertake new learning is working at Enrollment Services as a part-time Web Developer for almost two years. I have gained an understanding of a complex system that must adhere to many development standards and procedures. When starting out as a Web Developer, I had almost no prior experience building websites. I had built a small web page for my high school baseball team. Now, I have a great understanding of technologies such as PHP, MySQL, and Linux. I have had to make live production changes knowing well that there's a possibility it may break something. I also feel that my experience working at Iowa State has sparked my interest in web technologies. The Internet has opened up so many opportunities for our world, and I want to know all the low-level details of how it all works. The concept of REST Api is a particular subtopic that interests me. This experience also taught me that you never stop learning, I had no idea how much new information was available just from getting some industry experience.</p>
	    <p>Iowa State has taught me how to logically make sense of ethical situations when they arise. The project management class I took at ISU gave us many example scenarios where we were forced to make a difficult decision. If I am building a software that has significant safety risks, it is important that every testable scenario is tested to its fullest extent. If someone wants me to build a software that negatively affects people (i.e stealing money), it is important that the situation is handled properly. Iowa State has In the section below, you will see my analysis of a Therac-25 case study and how ethics are involved.</p>
	<h4>Helpful resources provided through ISU:</h4>
<pre>
Coover Labs	-  Provided collaboration space, software, and printing
Other Students	-  Experienced working in a group and giving/receiving feedback
Github		-  Version control makes it simple to access any project from anywhere
Web Hosting	-  Free web hosting space to allow us to experiment
</pre>
            <h3>General Education</h3>
            <p>A long-term goal I have is to utilize my engineering skills to positively impact a large-scale software project. To me, the industry I am working in isn’t as important as how many people the project affects. I want to know that what I do affects more than just a few people, and I want to take full responsibility for my work. Eventually, I would like to have a few products or systems that I call my own. A short-term goal I have is to improve my technical skills by learning new technologies. When working on side projects or a business project, I will often compare different technologies when deciding which one to use. Having a wide set of technical skills will help to ensure that I can solve a wide array of technical problems. Throughout my career at Iowa State, I took general courses that were unrelated to Computer Science and technology. These courses opened my mind to other fields, and helped me to solve problems in ways that I normally wouldn't think of. </p>
            <h4>Courses:</h4>
            <pre>
CL ST 273 –  Greek and Roman Mythology
PHIL 201  –  Introduction to Philosophy
ECON 101  –  Principles of Microeconomics
W S 205   –  Introduction to Queer Studies
PHIL 230  –  Moral theory and practice
POL S 241 –  Introduction to comparative government and politics
GEOL 105  –  Gems and Gemstones
PSYCH 131 –  Academic Learning Skills</pre>
          <p>All my general education classes contributed to my problem-solving abilities as an engineer. Philosophy helped me to think outside-the-box, and it also taught me to think logically when solving problems. Economics taught me the basics of how a business makes profit, which could be useful in a lot of different industries. Political science gave me some good insight about what’s going on in the rest of the world, and how to get relevant information related to politics. Queer Studies was a unique experience that helped me get out of my comfort zone. We talked about a lot of different issues that are difficult to talk about in a professional environment. My other general education classes were all very useful in developing my career as an engineer. Each class helped me to develop my research and problem-solving skills. The classes also taught me new information about current events and theories.</p>
          <p>General education classes are interesting because you have students from all different majors taking the same course. The thing that determines how successful you are in a general education class is your interest in the topic that the course is about. General education classes have taught me to pursue challenges or ideas that you have a passion for. Courses like philosophy have also given me an interesting viewpoint when faced with an ethical dilemma. We have been given many different controversial ethical situations where we must make a difficult decision. In business and engineering, it’s important to not be indecisive when we want to get things done.</p>    
          
          <h3>Ethics</h3>
          <p>In many courses I took at Iowa State, we were given example situations where we were forced to make a difficult ethical decision. One case study about a scandal with a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Therac-25 radiation therapy machine</a> caught my interest. Patients were given radiation therapy treatments that were potentially hundreds of times greater than the dose assigned for them. If you're interested, you can find the case study <a target="_blank" href="pdf/therac-25-case-study.pdf">here</a>. As Software Engineers, it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of the users using the software. In the next few paragraphs, I'll discuss how I would've handled the issue. 
          <p>An obvious thing to do was to test the machine. It is difficult to replicate the scenario where there is a 1-byte counter and it overflows at the exact time the user manually enters input into the machine. With a machine that carries that much impact on medical patients, it is important that every critical part of the machine is tested. This means they should run the program through hundreds of tests with expect dosages for different patients. If any of the tests fail, the product is not ready to be moved into a production phase. The root cause of the problem was that the software was designed in such a way that it was “realistically impossible to test in a clean and automated way”. If the product was tested properly, the concurrent programming bugs could have been fixed prior to the software being moved into a production phase.</p>
          <p>I think laziness is a big part of why the engineers did what they did. They probably had to deal with some sort of legacy system that wasn’t worth upgrading to perform automated tests. It could also be the case that the engineers had false confidence that their work was perfect, though, it wasn’t. You shouldn’t ever think your work is perfect in Software Engineering, when in doubt you should always test. I think from the start they didn’t have a good way to test the system. Instead of an engineer coming in to develop a new way of testing (boring and takes a lot of time), most engineers just want to be innovative and build the future product. Professionals want to write great code, amateurs want to impress you with features.</p>
